;;; Commentary:

;; This is a small attempt at cloc integration for Emacs. The functionality is
;; exposed through two functions: cloc, an interactive function which performs
;; a search through all buffers whose filepaths match the given regex (or the
;; current buffer, as desired), and counts lines of code in them. It also
;; exposes cloc-get-results-as-plists, a non-interactive function which does
;; the same thing, but parses and organizes it all into a list of plists for
;; easier analysis.

;; cloc will search over all buffers, including those which do not visit files,
;; and tramp buffers, but if the buffer is not visiting a file (and therefore
;; does not have a pathname), cloc will only be able to match the regex to the
;; buffer's buffer-name.

;; Example searches include: "\.cpp$", for all C++ sources files, or "/foo/",
;; where "/foo/" is the name of a project directory; cloc will then count all
;; code over all open buffers visiting files within a directory named foo.

;;; Usage:

;; M-x `cloc'
;; - Interactive function to run the executable "cloc" over all buffers with
;; pathname specified by a regex.
;; - If a prefix argument or a blank regex is given, the current buffer is
;; "cloc'd".
;; - cloc's entire summary output is given in the messages buffer.

;; ESC-: `cloc-get-results-as-plists'
;; - Non-interactive function to get output of cloc results as a list of plists.
;; - Each plist contains as a property the number of files analyzed, the blank
;; lines, the code lines, comment lines, etc. for a given language in the range
;; of files tested.
;; - If prefix-given is set to true, this runs on the current buffer. If not,
;; and a regex is given, it will search file-visiting buffers for file paths
;; matching the regex. If the regex is nil, it will prompt for a regex; putting
;; in a blank there will default to the current buffer.
